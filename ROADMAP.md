# ged_io Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development phases for the `ged_io` GEDCOM parsing library.

For current work items and detailed task tracking, see [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ge3224/ged_io/issues) and [Milestones](https://github.com/ge3224/ged_io/milestones).

## v0.3: Error Handling and Validation

The current parser works but needs better error reporting and input validation before it can be considered reliable for production use.

### Primary objectives
- Improve `GedcomError` enum with specific error types that include context (line numbers, problematic values)
- Implement validation against GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification rules
- Add builder pattern for parser configuration
- Implement standard traits (`Display`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, `Clone`) on core types
- Expand test coverage with real-world GEDCOM files and edge cases

### Expected outcomes
- Parser handles malformed input gracefully without panicking
- Clear error messages help users identify and fix data issues
- Test suite covers common real-world scenarios
- API is easier to use and configure

---

## v0.4: Performance and Memory Usage

Address performance bottlenecks and memory consumption, particularly for larger GEDCOM files.

### Primary objectives
- Set up benchmarking infrastructure using Criterion.rs
- Profile memory usage and identify optimization opportunities
- Implement memory-efficient string storage (`Box<str>`, string interning)
- Investigate streaming parser design for large files
- Optimize hot paths identified through profiling

### Expected outcomes
- Measurable performance improvements on benchmark suite
- Reduced memory footprint for typical usage patterns
- Ability to process larger files without excessive memory usage
- Baseline performance metrics for future comparisons

---

## v0.5: Write Support and Round-trip Integrity

Add the ability to write GEDCOM data back to files and ensure complete 5.5.1 specification compliance.

### Primary objectives
- Implement complete GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification support
- Add write functionality for `GedcomData` objects
- Ensure written files are specification-compliant
- Create round-trip tests (parse → write → parse → compare)
- Document any specification ambiguities or limitations

### Expected outcomes
- Library can both read and write GEDCOM files
- Round-trip operations preserve data integrity
- Complete feature parity with GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification
- Clear documentation of supported features

---

## v0.6: GEDCOM 7.0 Support

Add support for the GEDCOM 7.0 specification while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Primary objectives
- Update data structures to accommodate GEDCOM 7.0 features
- Implement 7.0 parser with format auto-detection
- Add 7.0 write support
- Maintain compatibility with existing 5.5.1 functionality
- Document migration path from 5.5.1 to 7.0

### Expected outcomes
- Library supports both GEDCOM 5.5.1 and 7.0 formats
- Users can parse files without knowing the format version
- Clear upgrade path for applications using the library

---

## v1.0: Documentation and Stability

Focus on API stability, comprehensive documentation, and community preparation.

### Primary objectives
- Finalize public API with semantic versioning commitment
- Write comprehensive documentation and examples
- Create contribution guidelines and issue templates
- Establish release process and version management
- Publish to crates.io

### Expected outcomes
- Stable public API suitable for production use
- Clear documentation for common use cases
- Established processes for community contributions
- Published crate available to Rust ecosystem

---

## Post-1.0 Considerations

Potential areas for future development, depending on community interest and practical need:

- Performance optimizations based on real-world usage patterns
- Additional output formats or conversion utilities
- Integration with genealogy software APIs
- Advanced validation and data quality tools
- WASM bindings for web applications
